# Hi there, I'm Shuke! 👋

I'm currently an **Electrical Engineering student** with a passion for **computer vision**. Exploring how machines "see" the world is just fascinating to me!

## 👨‍💻 Tech I Love
- **Python** (my go-to language for most things)
- **OpenCV & YOLO** (I’ve used them to solve some cool computer vision challenges)
- **C & C++** (not my main jam, but I can handle them!)

## 🕵️‍♂️ Cool Project Highlight
Measured real-world distances using only a single camera—with surprisingly precise results!  
*(Ask me about the math and code behind it, if you’re curious!)*

## 🎾 Outside of Tech...
- I’m a **badminton enthusiast** (always up for a match!)
- Love **watching movies** and **listening to music**—it’s how I unwind.
